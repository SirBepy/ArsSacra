                            Starting in June 1981, Mary has been said to visit 6 witnesses every day. The first time it happened was on the hill Podbrdo. The 6, then teenagers, testify that they saw a woman with a baby in her arms, immediately claiming she was Mary.
                            <br><br>
                            According to the testiomonies of these 6 people, Mary visits with a message every week, either based on peace, faith,  conversion, prayer and fasting.
                            <br><br>
                            Medugorje is Europe’s third most visited apparition site, with over 1 million people visiting every year. There is also an annual youth festival, “Mladifest” to which 50,000 young people and 400 priests visit every year. The most visited church is Saint James Church, which is conveniently only a minutes walk from our shop.

                            If you visit Medjugorje, you can learn a lot more by hiring a local tour-guide, but if you dont have the ability to visit, you can always just watch a documentary about it.
                            Out of the many documentaries, we chose to use this one made by "qopproductions". We hope you enjoy it.
