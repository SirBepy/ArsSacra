        <h1> Rubrics </h1>

        <p> The site is divided into six seperate pages: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Index Page <br>
          This is the page that the user first lands on. It shows roughly what the website is all about,
            with a large Shop Now button leading to the online shop.
          </li>

          <li> Show Page <br>
          This is where the user goes to shop. It is divided into two categories Chasubles and Stoles.
          When clicking on one of these, the user is led to the shop to buy that specific object.</li>

          <li> History Page <br>
          This page has content on the history of Medugorje, the town in which the shop is. </li>

          <li> Location Page <br>
          This page shows where the user can find the shop - including a Google Maps embeded map. </li>

          <li> To Do Page <br>
          This page is like a 'Bucket List'. It consists of places where the user can visit and places
          where the user can eat.</li>

          <li> About Page <br>
          On this page the user can see what the shop's working times are, along with contact information.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          All content is spell-checked and I believe sufficient, giving the user all the information he/she needs.
          I believe the navigation is easy to understand and navigate through. The design is simple and similar on all
          sites.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="bottom-padding-10">
        <h1> Grading Rubrics </h1>
          <ul>
            <li> Content  <br>
              I believe my content was sufficient, as I didn't want to overwhelm the user with irrelevant info.
              Perhaps I could have gone more overboard on the history page but I didnt think the user needed that information, giving the fact that this is an online shop.

            </li>

            <li> Navigation <br>
              I purposely made the navigation the way I did. The only way to get to these two sites (rubrics, refferences) is by accessing the in the footer.
              I also believe my navigation bar fits in nicely with my website.
            </li>

            <li> Organization <br>

              Everything is perfectly organised.
            </li>

            <li> Design <br>

              I have thought about the design for a while and I think everything goes together nicely. I'm sure I could have done a better job, but this is the best I can do for now.
            </li>

            <li> HTML/CSS </li>
